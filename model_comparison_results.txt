Pages 101-110: These pages finalize the crankshaft/crankcase section, including replacing the 1.9L crankcase and then begin the cylinder head and valve drive section.  Finally, on page 110, we find the procedure for "Hydraulic valve lifters, adjusting" for the air-cooled engine.

Pages 111-120: These pages continue with the "Engine - Cylinder Head, Valve Drive" section, covering topics like bleeding the lifters and various procedures for diesel engines. Page 110 provided the initial steps but no mention of bleeding. Page 111 describes the bleeding procedure for air-cooled engines. 

Pages 121-130: These pages provide information regarding compression checking for diesel engines, cylinder heads for water-cooled engines, valve dimensions, valve seats and guides. Page 128 describes installing the cylinder head and on page 129 the adjusting procedure for hydraulic lifters is detailed for water-cooled engines. 129 also gives directions on bleeding the water-cooled engines. Page 130 describes pushrod tube replacement.

Final Answer:
Air-cooled engine (page 110):

1. Set adjusting screws in rocker arms so that adjusting screws just touch valve stems with feeler gauge 0.10-0.15 mm installed.

2. Turn adjusting screws in by one full turn.

3. Tighten lock nuts.

Also covered on page 110 is how to bleed the air-cooled lifters. Bleeding should be done before installing, by checking thumb pressure on push rod socket and after the engine is started, by opening the valve with a scriber so oil can come out of the lower part of the plunger.  If no oil comes out perform the provided procedure to bleed them.


Water-cooled engine (page 129):

1. Back out adjusting screws in rocker arms so that they no longer contact valve stems.

2. Turn crankshaft until cylinder No. 1 is at TDC firing position. Distributor rotor marking must be in line with mark on distributor housing.

3. Turn adjusting screws in until they just touch valve stems.

4. Turn adjusting screws 2 turns clockwise and tighten lock nuts.

5. Rotate crankshaft 180° and adjust next cylinder in firing order.

6. Repeat until all cylinders are adjusted.

Also covered on page 129 is bleeding the lifters before installation by applying firm thumb pressure. If the pushrod does not move, the lifter is bled correctly. If the lifter is not bled correctly the instructions are given on how to do so.
