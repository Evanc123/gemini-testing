Turn adjusting screws in until they just touch valve stems, and then back out adjusting screws by 2 turns. \n\n4. Turn adjusting screws in 2 turns clockwise and tighten lock nuts.\n\n5. Rotate crankshaft 180\u00b0 and adjust next cylinder.\n\n6. Repeat until all cylinders are adjusted.\n\n**Water-cooled engine (page 128):**\n\n1. Ensure push rod tube has small end face.\n\n2. Cylinder head must be installed within 45 minutes of sealant application.\n\n3. When installing cylinder head, the 7 cap nuts must be just enough so that all remaining stud cap nuts can be installed.\n\n4. Tighten cylinder cap nut with AKD 456 000 01 torque wrench.\n\n\nAlso refer to the bleeding procedures for air-cooled engines (page 111) and water-cooled engines (page 129) after adjusting the lifters.",
