Since the manual covers multiple engine types, I need to check the procedures for both the air-cooled and water-cooled engines. The index on page 14 points to page 110 for the air-cooled procedure, and pages 123 and 128 likely contain the information for water-cooled engines based on my scan.\n\nAir-Cooled Engine (Page 110):\nThe procedure involves setting adjusting screws, turning the crankshaft, and repeating for each cylinder.\n\nWater-Cooled Engine (Page 128): The procedure is similar to the air-cooled engine but involves using tool AKD 456 000 01 and a specific tightening sequence.\n\n3.

Nothing relevant to the query.\n\nPages 91-100: Still focused on crankshaft and crankcase, but I haven't found what I'm looking for yet.\n\nPages 101-110: Continue with engine crankshaft and crankcase information.  Nothing about valve adjusting discs.\n\nPages 111-120: Cylinder head and valve drive information appears here. Page 115 might contain the table with valve adjusting discs and thicknesses.\n\nPages 121-130: More cylinder head information, including checking compression. No further valve adjusting disc information.\n\nPages 131-136: No further valve adjusting disc information.\n\n\n2. ****\n\nThe index pointed to pages 114 and 115 for the \"Valve adjusting disc\". I'll focus there and extract the relevant data from page 115.\n\n**Page 115 Table:**\n\n| Thick- | Part Number | Thick- | Part Number |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| ness |  | ness |  |\n| 3.00 | 056 109 555 | 3.55 | 056 109 568 |\n| 3.05 | 056 109 556 | 3.60 | 056 109 569 |\n| 3.10 | 056 109 557 | 3.65 | 056 109 570 |\n| 3.15 | 056 109 558 | 3.80 | 056 109 571 |\n| 3.20 | 056 109 559 | 3.85 | 056 109 572 |\n| 3.25 | 056 109 560 | 3.90 | 056 109 573 |\n| 3.30 | 056 109 561 | 3.95 | 056 109 574 |\n| 3.35 | 056 109 562 | 4.00 | 056 109 575 |\n| 3.40 | 056 109 563 | 4.05 | 056 109 576 |\n| 3.45 | 056 109 564 | 4.10 | 056 109 577 |\n| 3.50 | 056 109 565 | 4.15 | 056 109 578 |\n| --- | 056 109 566 | 4.20 | 056 109 579 |\n| 3.55 | 056 109 567 | 4.25 | 056 109 580 |\n\n\n3. **Error Correction:** No errors detected.\n\n4. **",
